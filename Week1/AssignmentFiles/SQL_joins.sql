-- Q1) Join products to categories: list product_name, category_name, price.
select p.name, c.name as category_name, p.price
from products p
join categories c on p.category_id = c.category_id;


-- Q2) For each order item, show: order_id, order_datetime, store_name,
--     product_name, quantity, line_total (= quantity * products.price).
--     Sort by order_datetime, then order_id.

-- Q3) Customer order history (PAID only):
--     For each order, show customer_name, store_name, order_datetime,
--     order_total (= SUM(quantity * products.price) per order).

--     Return first_name, last_name, city, state.

-- Q5) For each store, list the top-selling product by units (PAID only).
--     Return store_name, product_name, total_units.
--     Hint: Use a window function (ROW_NUMBER PARTITION BY store) or a correlated subquery.

--     (Assume title = 'Manager').

--     the average PAID product revenue. Return product_name, total_revenue.

-- Q9) Churn-ish check: list customers with their last PAID order date.
--     If they have no PAID orders, show NULL.
--     Hint: Put the status filter in the LEFT JOIN's ON clause to preserve non-buyer rows.
